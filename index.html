    <p> My name is Shania Kimbrough. I am an army veteran with over 8 years experience as an analyst. I am from the
        great state of Texas, but Arizona is home for now. I currently work in Special/Personnel Security for soldiers
        on Ft. Huachuca. My hobbies include watching horror movies, reading, and gaming. My favorite author is Stephen
        King and my favorite game currently is cyberpunk 2077. I recently became a mother and I couldn't be happier. I
        live at home with my husband, daughter, and two cats. Click here to be linked to my Github profile.</p>
